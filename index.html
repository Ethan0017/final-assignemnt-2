                    <p>The majority of the population understand the precipitation of their area,
                        however when it comes to the bigger picture, the same cannot be said.

                    <div id="world_map"></div>
                    <p>Rainfall, also known as precipitation, varies greatly throughout the globe.
                       While this is common knowledge, the distribution of this varied rainfall is
                       not as well known. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The above world map shows exactly how much precipitation
                       different countries around the world experience on a yearly basis.</p>

                <p>Each continet experiences a vastly different amount of rainfall to one another.</p>
                <p>The above visualisations explain what proportion of the total global rainfall each continent experiences, 
                    and how that has changed over the years.</p>

                <p>A common stereotype is that the climate (temperature) determines an areas rainfall, 
                    the above visualisation shows no trend supporting this statement.</p>
